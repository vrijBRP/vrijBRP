## Goal

### OPEN, UP-TO-DATE AND RELIABLE

In order to *really* innovate, the whole structure of municipal IT
systems and software needs changing. From closed systems and strong
supplier dependence towards a dynamic development environment in
which municipalities themselves are in control.

Procura supports the ideas of Common Ground and strives for a community
of municipalities, commercial suppliers and other partners in this chain
to jointly manage a freely available BRP (Municipal Personal Records
Database).  As a starting point, we have made our own source code available.
This provides a robust basis: BRP software that has proven itself at
municipalities and earns high scores on customer satisfaction.

Based on this, members of the community can create new applications, and
further develop the platform in a direction the community as a whole
chooses to go.

## Conditions

In order to participate in this project (in every form or way), it is
conditional that said license is accepted.

### Conditions for developers

The final conditions that haven to be met in order to contribute to
this software are not entirely clear yet. That also depends on the goal.
The contribution can either be working on the code (Java), but it can
also be an addition of functionality using APIs (not tied to Java).

A "getting started" document will be added at a later stage.

### Conditions of use

To use vrijBRP, please contact info@vrijbrp.nl.
More information will be added here at a later time.

## Installation

Information will be added at a later stage.
[Installation guide](INSTALL.md) is empty (for now).

## Interaction

In [interaction](INTERACTION.md) we will describe what we expect from
contributors and what contributors can expect from Procura. This still
needs to be worked out in more detail. For questions at this stage,
please contact info@vrijbrp.nl.

## ROADMAP

[ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)

The roadmap will eventually be determined by the community. For now, we are working on:

- SaaS implementation
- APIs for e-services
- Module for naturalization/opting
- Processing BAG mutations from national facility
- Program VRS (improving system for traveldocuments) in collaboration
  with RvIG (Ministry of Internal Affairs)
